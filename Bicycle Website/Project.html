                        A bicycle or bike is a small, human powered land vehicle with a seat, two wheels, two pedals,
                        and
                        a metal chain connected to cogs on the pedals and rear wheel. A frame gives the bike strength,
                        and
                        the other parts are attached to the frame. The name comes from these two words - the prefix
                        bi-meaning two, and the suffix-cycle meaning wheel. It is powered by a person riding on top, who
                        pushes the pedals around with his or her feet.

                    <h3>Single day : </h3>
                    <p>Professional single-day race distances may be as long as 180 miles (290 km).
                        Courses may run from place to place or comprise one or more laps of a circuit; some courses
                        combine
                        both, i.e., taking the riders from a starting place and then finishing with several laps of a
                        circuit (usually to ensure a good spectacle for spectators at the finish). Races over short
                        circuits, often in town or city centres, are known as criteriums. Some races, known as
                        handicaps,
                        are designed to match riders of different abilities and/or ages; groups of slower riders start
                        first, with the fastest riders starting last and so having to race harder and faster to catch
                        other
                        competitors.

                    <h3>Stage races : </h3>
                    <p>Stage races
                        Stage races consist of several races, or stages, ridden consecutively. The competitor with the
                        lowest cumulative time to complete all stages is declared the overall, or general classification
                        (GC), winner. Stage races may also have other classifications and awards, such as individual
                        stage winners, the points classification winner, and the "King of the Mountains" (or mountains
                        classification) winner. A stage race can also be a series of road races and individual time
                        trials (some events include team time trials). The stage winner is the first person to cross the
                        finish line that day or the time trial rider (or team) with the lowest time on the course.

                <div class="grid_4 third_part">
                    The overall winner of a stage race is the rider who takes the lowest aggregate time to complete all
                    stages (accordingly, a rider does not have to win all or any of the individual stages to win
                    overall). Three-week stage races are called Grand Tours. The professional road bicycle racing
                    calendar includes three Grand Tours - the Giro d'Italia, the Tour de France, and the Vuelta a
                    Espana.
